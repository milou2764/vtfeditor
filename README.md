## VTF Editor
Open source VTF editor coded in java.
Work in progress.
The app only opens square texture in 7.2 VTF version with DXT1 or DXT5 compression.

## Motivation
There is no good app to handle VTF files in linux OS.
Since it is a java app it can run in others OS too and it makes life easier when you have the same app for all your OS because eventually you become familiar with it.
